Meeting notes:

1. Find the starting point of POM (maybe investigating the POM Tests)
2. Setup the project

Things we need to know about this project (ask the questions):
1. How to use the tools?
2. What kind of program we need to create (a console program / an extension to the Ptidej UI Viewer Standalone Swing)
3. Do we need to add visitor pattern the the tools that we will create?
4. Should we go through padl.kernel.IFirstClassEntity (and possibly all padl.kernel.IEntity) and padl.kernel.IRelationship and its sub-interfaces and write accept methods for these interfaces or are we wrong?
